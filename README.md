<h4 align="center">NBT is an open cryptocurrency trading bot development framework for the Binance exchange.</h4>

NBT includes 3 main JS scripts:

* the **server**:

  * to track a selection of asset pairs and record all binance api data (candles, depths, trades) into a Postgres database.
  * to detect buy or sell signals
  * (optional) to send trading signals to the NBT Hub / [Bitcoin vs. Altcoins](https://bitcoinvsaltcoins.com) to monitor performances and auto trade those signals (virtually or for real).

* the **trader**:

  * this script allows you to auto trade the signals received from the NBT hub or your own server.

* the **backtest** :

  * to backtest your strategies on the historical tick data (Postgres database) recorded by the server.
